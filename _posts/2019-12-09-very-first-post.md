title: Very first post

I haven't written thigns on the Internet for a long time. There's not a
specific reason why I stopped sharing my life online with others. I'd like to
leave things, any kind of things.

The Internet has become a great tool with which we can do any kind of things
useful and necessary for living. However, at the same time, it became a kind of
weapon threatening our lives in the aspect of privacy. It's awkward and bizarre
('bizarre', a word the french like to use) to imagine living without the
'tool'. Then, what can we do to protect ourselves while using and having fun
with the 'Internet'? Well, there's not a perfect answer which can solve the
paradox of the 'Internet'. At least, however, I'm pretty sure there would be
several ways and that's our job to find them.

I'm going to post different things not limited to a specific category. They
could be written in English, French or Korean. On verra.
