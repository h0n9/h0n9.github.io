It's been a quite long time since I didn't write thigns on the Internet.
There's not a specific reason why I stopped sharing my life online with the
others. But, I'd like to leave things, any kind of things.

The Internet is now a great tool with which we can do any kind of things
useful and necessary for living our lives. But, at the same time, it became a
great weapon threatening the aspect of privacy of our lives. It's awkward and
bizarre ('bizarre' is a word the french people like to use) to imagine living
without the 'tool'. Then, what can we do to protect ourselves while using and
having fun with the 'Internet'? Well, there's not a perfect answer which can
solve the paradox of the 'Internet'. But, at least I'm pretty sure that there
would be several ways and tt's our job to find them.

I'm going to post lots of different things not limited to a specific category.
They could be written in French, English or Korean. On verra.
